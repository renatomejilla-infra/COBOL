***************************

Stage 1: Core COBOL Programming (Business Logic)
These mimic batch jobs or small programs.


Customer Data Formatting
------------------------

Accept a customer’s First Name, Last Name, and Birth Date.
Output in the format: LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME (Age: XX).
Add input validation (e.g., date must be valid).


Payroll Calculation
-------------------

Input: Employee Name, Hours Worked, Hourly Rate.
Calculate Gross Pay, Tax (12%), and Net Pay.
Display in a formatted report-like output.


Bank Transaction Batch
----------------------

Read an input file (fixed-length records) containing deposits and withdrawals.
Update an account balance per record.
Generate an end-of-day report showing all transactions and the final balance.

======================================================================================

Stage 2: File Handling & Data Processing
COBOL jobs often work with flat files or indexed files.

Student Grade Report (Sequential File)
--------------------------------------

Create an input file with student records (ID, Name, 3 Grades).
Calculate average and assign Pass/Fail.
Write results into an output report file.


Employee Master File (Indexed File)
-----------------------------------

Create an indexed file with key = Employee ID.
Write a program to:
Add new employees
Update salary
Delete employees
Retrieve employee by ID

======================================================================================

Stage 3: Database Interaction (Like Real COBOL Jobs)
Many modern COBOL jobs involve DB2, Oracle, or SQL Server.
Since you’re using Visual COBOL, you can connect to SQL Server or PostgreSQL.

Accounts Database
-----------------

Create a table: ACCOUNTS (ACC_ID, NAME, BALANCE).
Write a COBOL program to:
Insert a new account.
Update balance after deposit/withdrawal.
Retrieve and display account details.

Order Processing
----------------

Tables: CUSTOMERS, ORDERS.
Program should:
Accept customer ID.
Insert a new order.
Display all orders for that customer with total amount.

======================================================================================

Stage 4: Job Control & Modularization
Program Calling

Write a main driver program that calls multiple COBOL subprograms:
------------------------------------------------------------------

SUB-INPUT → Reads customer info.
SUB-CALC → Calculates totals.
SUB-REPORT → Generates formatted output.

Batch Simulation
----------------

Program reads daily transactions (file), updates the master account database, and produces reports.
Mimic a nightly job run.

======================================================================================

Stage 5: Real-World Simulation (End-to-End Mini-Project)
Mini Banking System (Capstone)

Create an Account Master File or SQL Table.
-------------------------------------------

Support operations:
Open Account
Deposit
Withdraw
Balance Inquiry
Close Account
Store all transactions in a Transaction Log File.
Generate a Daily Statement Report.
